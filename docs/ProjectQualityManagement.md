<h2>Project Quality Management</h2>  
<h4>Planning quality management:</h4> The Quality Management Plan defines the acceptable level of quality and how quality will be managed throughout the lifecycle of the project.</br>
All the project team members will play a role in quality management. It is important that the team ensures that work is completed and has adequate level of quality to the final project deliverable. </br>
The project sponsor is responsible for approving the quality standards of our project. He/she will sign the final acceptance of the project deliverable. The project Manager will work with specialists to develop the standards for acceptable quality. </br>
<h4>Quality Metrics</h4>
First we will conduct Unit testing for every individual component in our project and we will perform Integration testing so that we can ensure that every functionality is working, then we will perform system testing so that we can ensure our website is working. Now we will ask user to test the website so that user acceptance test can be performed. If there are any change said by user then we will try to update our website, perform all the test, ensure quality and send the website to the user to perform user acceptance test. Only testing is not enough so we test our website with experts. </br>
